This script will:

Define mappings between shell scripts and their expected manifest references

Check if all required manifests exist

Verify if scripts properly reference their manifests

Provide suggestions for missing references

Optionally fix missing references automatically

The script can be extended by:

Adding more script-to-manifest mappings in the MANIFEST_MAPPINGS array

Adding more sophisticated manifest handling based on file type

Adding validation for specific manifest content

Adding checks for correct kubectl/aws commands

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this validation script or add additional functionality?
